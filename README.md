The airline ticket booking system that we worked on ensures total freedom to the user,
where user can book his/her ticket. The airline ticket booking system allows users only to
reserve the tickets to and fro between 8 cities in a span of one month. The ticket booking process
starts by displaying a menu where the user is asked to select his choice in booking an air ticket or
cancelling his previously booked ticket or getting the boarding pass for the previously booked
ticket to travel. The ticket booking system gives the user freedom to select a from and to destination
then select a choice of available flights shown based on his convenience. The user can also specify
the no.of tickets he is willing to buy, give the passengerâ€™s details and complete the payment process
to get his booking done. The user also has choices on which he can decide to pay the amount
required for his travel. Upon successful booking the ticket is printed and each passenger is given
a unique PNR-ID which he can use for further reference for getting boarding pass prior to travel
or cancel the ticket if necessary.
